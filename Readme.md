- Identifies screenshot files based on their extensions (`.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.bmp`).
- Deletes the identified files with error handling.
- Configurable and extensible for additional file types or folder paths.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- A valid `config.json` file with folder paths.
